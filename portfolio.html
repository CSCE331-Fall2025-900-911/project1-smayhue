<div class="pixelMouse">

<p class="desc">This was one of my first real projects as a student at Texas A&M University. It was hosted by IEEE and was called the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2024/03/student-team-takes-first-at-national-competition-with-interactive-game.html" target="_blank">PixelMouse Competition</a>. The goal was to build an Arduino-based game controller to play a basic maze video game given a set of controls/abilities. I was put into a team of 5, and it was a ton of fun. We met several times over the course of a month or two, and the finished product worked really well! It definitely didnâ€™t look pretty (as you can see), but we met our functionality goals and it felt like a rousing success to freshman-year me!</p>

<div class="fourBitALU">

<p class="desc">This project was my first foray into computer engineering. Through our combinational logic class, we were tasked with building a basic 4-bit ALU that could perform simple operations like adding, subtracting, and logical AND. This was by far one of the most difficult projects of the semester, as it required very fine manipulation of the logic gates and jumper wires (and there were a LOT of them). However, seeing the ALU function properly was extremely rewarding and really made me appreciate the complexity and efficiency of modern computing machines.</p>

<div class="CASComp">

<p class="desc">Similarly to the PixelMouse controller, this project was done mainly through my connections in IEEE. A couple friends of mine had written a paper on using graph embeddings to detect hardware trojans. It sounded extremely interesting and, fortunately for me, they asked me to join their team as a test engineer for the upcoming <a href="https://ieee-cas.org/society-involvement/student-design-competition" target="_blank">IEEE CAS (Circuits and Systems Society) competition</a>. My main role was developing and testing specific hardware trojans on an FPGA, which would disrupt an RS-232 communication protocol between an ESP32 chip and a computer. The computer, using novel detection methods, would then be able to determine if a hardware trojan was indeed present. For the final demo, the team and I ended up placing in fourth.</p>
