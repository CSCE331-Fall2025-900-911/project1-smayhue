<h2 align="center">Technical Skills</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verilog HDL and FPGA Development:</strong> Digital design and verification is my foremost area of interest, so development with Verilog and FPGA's are probably my greatest strengths. Through my computer architecture class, a working knowledge of Verilog was required to design many of the class projects, including a fully-functional single-cycle CPU. I also participated in an IEEE design competition using a project based in Verilog. Over the summer, I continued to improve my Verilog skills and am now quite comfortable with the language.</li>
<li><strong>C++:</strong> Proficiency in C++ is a close second in terms of my strongest technical skills. Almost every engineering course's curriculum at Texas A&M is done in C++, as it provides an excellent understanding of lower-level programming languages and memory management. As a result, most of my coding done inside and outside of class has been in this language, and it is by far the one I am most comfortable with.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Office 365:</strong>Though often overlooked, being proficient in the Microsoft Office suite of products is incredibly useful in today's corporate environment. Most of my schoolwork is completed using tools like Microsoft Word and Excel, and I can definitely transfer these skills over to other workplace environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Areas of Interest</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Design/Verification:</strong> Ever since learning about Verilog, the concept of building and testing a virtual circuit has fascinated me. It allows you to tinker with the concepts of electrical engineering without ever having to acquire the proper analog components or resources. This intersection between electrical engineering and computer science is very interesting to me, and it is a direction which I would like to pursue even further.
<li><strong>Digital Signal Processing:</strong> This is another field that I feel perfectly strikes a balance between computer science and electrical engineering. A good knowledge of algorithms and data sampling/acquisition is a necessity for this field as well as an excellent understanding of signals and systems. There are also plenty of applications to music recording and audio design, which also seem like interesting fields.
