<p class = "desc">Howdy! My name’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seth.mayhue/" target="_blank">Seth</a>, and I’d first like to thank you for visiting my page! Ever since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by technology and, most especially, computers. Whether I was playing a video game or researching information for a school project, computers were an essential part of my day-to-day life, yet I had no understanding of how they actually worked! Beginning in high school, my passion began to take off, as I built my own rig at home, started taking computer science classes, and even interned for the <a href="https://www.fortworthtexas.gov/departments/it-solutions" target="_blank">IT Department of the City of Fort Worth</a>. Being a devout Texan, I naturally applied to Texas A&M for my undergraduate education in computer engineering, and I’ve loved every minute of my studies here in Aggieland! That’s about all the background you need to know, so please take a look around my site to gain an insight into my professional and personal interests along with upcoming project plans.</p>

<p class="desc">One of my biggest commitments here on campus is no doubt the <a href="https://ieeetamu.org" target="_blank">Texas A&M branch of IEEE</a> (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). This organization was introduced to me in my freshman year, and it provided a home for me at a time when I felt lost and confused in the vast sea that is Texas A&M! Through my time as a member, I was able to attend technical workshops, meet other students in my major, and develop my professional skills at corporate events. These opportunities and many others were so rewarding and influential on my college experience that I decided to become a corporate officer for the org last year, where I reached out to companies and helped plan career fairs and talks with recruiters. This year, I was elected Vice President of the organization, and I am so excited to be able to support IEEE even more in its valuable mission of fostering technological innovation and excellence. We have a lot of great events planned for this year, and I hope you’ll check out our socials for more information!</p>

<p class="desc">Apart from IEEE, I also spend a lot of my time on campus in <a href="https://tamurobomasters.com/" target="_blank">Texas A&M RoboMasters</a>. At the beginning of sophomore year, I was looking for a chance to delve into a more technical organization that could provide me with solid programming or hardware experience, and RoboMasters immediately caught my eye. At the insistence of my roommate who was also part of the org, I applied to be on the embedded subteam and was accepted! For the past year, my team and I have worked on the firmware for seven competition-level robots in one of the most competitive collegiate robotics competitions in the nation. Every day presents a new challenge, and it’s that fact that keeps me coming back each semester. My skills in C++ and Git have increased significantly because of my time here, and I’m proud to help our robots achieve victory (or at least get close) every time we compete!</p>

<div class="pocketChange">

<img src = "pocketChange.jpg" alt="Pocket Change" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<p class="desc">Besides my more technical organizations and commitments, I have several other passions that fill my free time. For one, I love music and have played various instruments over the years. Right now, I mainly play the bass guitar, but I dabble in piano and acoustic guitar as well. My favorite part about playing music is the chance to perform with a band in front of a live audience. In my opinion, there’s no feeling like it, and my band <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pocketchange.mp3/" target="_blank">Pocket Change</a> has been performing for over a year now with no signs of stopping. Besides music, I also love to run (I ran the Blue Bell Half Marathon in Brenham earlier this year!) and have been trying to pick up cooking as a hobby that will no doubt prove useful as I begin living on my own. In the coming years, who knows what else I will pick up!</p>
