<h2>IEEE-HKN</h2>
<p>For the <a href="https://www.hkntamu.com/" target="_blank">IEEE-HKN chapter here at Texas A&M</a>, service is a requirement to be a part of the organization, and (usually) it's a ton of fun! On certain weekends, my fellow members and I will sign up to serve various nonprofits in the Bryan-College Station area to help out the community. It is extremely fulfilling and a great way to make connections with other members of the org and the people of BCS as well!</p>
<h2>IEEE</h2>
<p>To a much broader extent, I'd like to think I also serve my Aggie community through my experience with IEEE and my role as Vice President of the org. It is my privilege to be able to plan activites and events that will go on to help our members meet other students, network with industry professionals, and, in some cases, get internships or jobs. I get worried freshmen approaching me all the time about what they should do to succeed at A&M, and I am delighted when I can help ease those worries! Pictured above is our kickoff for this year, which had nearly 200 attendees.</p> 
<h2>Future Service</h2>
<p>In an upcoming semester, I also plan on becoming a Teacher's Assistant or a peer mentor to help support my fellow Aggies. Going through the difficult engineering curriculum of Texas A&M has made me realize how important TA's can be both to the professor and students alike and how their expertise can support an entire class. Hopefully, my skills will be enough to offer that same support!</p>
